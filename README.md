# CatalogIQ---AI-Powered-Product-Catalog-Management-System
CatalogIQ  üõ†Ô∏è is an AI-powered product catalog manager üìä for e-commerce, grocery stores, and more. Using LLMs  üß†, RAG  üìö, and Entity Resolution  üîç, it automates metadata generation üè∑Ô∏è, detects duplicates ‚ÜîÔ∏è, and solves the cold start problem ‚ùÑÔ∏è. Streamline inventory management üöÄ with consistent, high-quality data! ‚ú®

Problem Statement  

    Manual Metadata Entry : Adding new products to a catalog is time-consuming and error-prone, especially for businesses with thousands of SKUs.
    Cold Start Problem : New merchants or unfamiliar products (e.g., private-label items) lack sufficient metadata, making it hard to categorize them accurately.
    Duplicate Products : Identifying whether two product descriptions refer to the same item is challenging, leading to cluttered catalogs and poor user experience.
    Scalability : Traditional methods of catalog management struggle to scale with growing inventories and diverse product ranges.
     

Solution  

CatalogIQ  addresses these challenges by combining: 

    LLMs (e.g., Llama 3 via Groq)  for generating rich metadata and resolving ambiguities.
    RAG  for retrieving similar products from an internal knowledge base.
    Entity Resolution  using embeddings and vector databases to identify duplicates.
    Automation : Reduces manual effort and speeds up the cataloging process by 90% .
     

Key Features  

    Automated Metadata Generation : 
        Use LLMs to extract attributes like category, brand, size, flavor, and tags from product descriptions.
        Example: Input: "Coca-Cola Classic Soft Drink, 500ml" ‚Üí Output: {category: "Beverage", brand: "Coca-Cola", size: "500ml", flavor: "Classic"}.
         

    Cold Start Problem Solver : 
        For unfamiliar products, use traditional NLP techniques (e.g., keyword extraction) for initial tagging.
        If unsure, query the LLM for deeper insights.
         

    Similarity Search with RAG : 
        Use embeddings (e.g., Sentence Transformers) to find similar products in a vector database.
        Retrieve relevant information from an internal knowledge graph to determine if the product is unique.
         

    Entity Resolution : 
        Compare embedding vectors of product names to detect duplicates.
        Use LLM reasoning to confirm if two descriptions refer to the same item (e.g., "Coke 500ml" vs. "Coca-Cola Classic Soft Drink, 500ml").
         

    Scalable Architecture : 
        Use a vector database (e.g., Pinecone, FAISS) for efficient similarity searches.
        Build a knowledge graph (e.g., Neo4j) for advanced relationships between products.
         

    User-Friendly Interface : 
        Provide a dashboard for users to upload product descriptions, view generated metadata, and resolve duplicates.
         
     

Technical Stack  
Backend  

    Python
    Flask/Django for API and web interface
    Groq API for LLM integration (Llama 3)
    Sentence Transformers for embeddings
     

Database  

    PostgreSQL/MySQL for structured data
    Vector Database: Pinecone, FAISS, or Milvus for embeddings
    Knowledge Graph: Neo4j (optional)
     

Frontend  

    React.js or Vue.js for a modern UI
    Tailwind CSS for styling
     

Cloud Deployment  

    AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting
    Docker for containerization
     

Workflow  

    Input : A user uploads a product description (e.g., "Kirkland Signature Organic Quinoa, 2kg").
    Metadata Generation :
        The system uses LLMs to generate attributes like {category: "Grocery", brand: "Kirkland", size: "2kg", type: "Quinoa"}.
         
    Cold Start Handling :
        If the product is unfamiliar, the system performs additional searches using RAG and LLM reasoning.
         
    Similarity Search :
        Embeddings are generated for the product name and compared against existing products in the vector database.
        If a similar product is found, the system suggests it to the user.
         
    Entity Resolution :
        The system determines if the product is a duplicate using cosine similarity and LLM reasoning.
         
    Output :
        The product is added to the catalog with enriched metadata, or flagged as a duplicate.
